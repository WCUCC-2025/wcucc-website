			<p class="m-0 text-lg font-light">
				Dr. Hoby Wedler is a chemist, entrepreneur, sensory expert, and
				advocate for inclusivity in science. Born completely blind, Dr.
				Wedler has continuously defied expectations, earning his Ph.D.
				in organic chemistry from UC Davis in 2016. He has since become
				a highly sought-after motivational speaker, mentor, and
				educator, dedicated to making the world more inclusive and
				accessible. In 2011, Dr. Wedler founded a non-profit
				organization to host annual chemistry camps for blind and
				visually impaired students across North America. That same year,
				he expanded his impact by creating Tasting in the Dark, a unique
				blindfolded wine-tasting experience that explores the world of
				aromas without visual influence. Dr. Wedler's groundbreaking
				work has earned him numerous accolades, including being named a
				Champion of Change by former U.S. President Barack Obama, a
				Forbes "30 Under 30" in Food and Drink, and a Wine Enthusiast
				"40 Under 40 Tastemaker."
