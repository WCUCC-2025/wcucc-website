biography: 'Dr. Hoby Wedler is a chemist, entrepreneur, sensory expert, and advocate for inclusivity in science. Born completely blind, Dr. Wedler has continuously defied expectations, earning his Ph.D. in organic chemistry from UC Davis in 2016. He has since become a highly sought-after motivational speaker, mentor, and educator, dedicated to making the world more inclusive and accessible. In 2011, Dr. Wedler founded a non-profit organization to host annual chemistry camps for blind and visually impaired students across North America. That same year, he expanded his impact by creating Tasting in the Dark, a unique blindfolded wine-tasting experience that explores the world of aromas without visual influence. Dr. Wedlerâ€™s groundbreaking work has earned him numerous accolades, including being named a Champion of Change by former U.S. President Barack Obama, a Forbes "30 Under 30", and in 2017 was awarded the Diversity and Inclusion Prize by the Royal Society of Chemistry.'
