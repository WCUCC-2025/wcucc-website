abstract: "Dr. Hoby Wedler is an organic chemist and entrepreneur who has been completely blind since birth. During this seminar, Hoby will focus on his chemical research in graduate school, focusing specific attention on accessibility and how he made a computational organic chemistry lab accessible to him with minimal sighted assistance. Hoby will then outline work he is currently doing to make experimental research laboratories accessible to blind and low vision researchers. Finally, Hoby will discuss his current work as an entrepreneur and how he applies chemistry to everything he does."
