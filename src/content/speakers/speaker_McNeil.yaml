biography: "Dr. W. Stephen McNeil is an Associate Professor at the Okanagan campus of the University of British Columbia in Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada. He is a recipient of the UBC Okanagan Killam Teaching Prize, the Chemical Institute of Canada Chemistry Education Award, and the BC Teaching and Learning Council West Coast Teaching Excellence Award. His chemistry education research interests include the development and assessment of active- and collaborative-learning methods and innovative student-engagement strategies in introductory chemistry, and the impacts of active learning and context-embedded science curricula on affective learning constructs including student senses of identity and belonging."
talkTitle: "Interior Salish Pit Cooking Practices as a Contextual Framework in Introductory Chemistry"
abstract: >
  As part of a long-term project to revise the curriculum, learning objectives, and delivery of the first-year chemistry sequence at The University of British Columbia’s Okanagan campus, we have developed a range of context study activities that meaningfully demonstrate the applicability of introductory chemistry concepts to issues of societal and environmental relevance, an approach that both reinforces those concepts and increases student interest and appreciation for the roles of chemistry and chemical knowledge to their lives and society.

  One context study draws meaningful connections from course concepts to local Indigenous knowledge, based on the sophisticated and complex process by which the taproot of balsamroot (Balsamorhiza sagittata) is heated in elaborate cooking pits, as traditionally practiced by the Syilx and Secwépemc peoples of the British Columbia Interior Plateau. This process transforms the indigestible complex carbohydrate inulin into a high-energy food source. The necessity for each step in the pit-cooking process can be understood in terms of principles of chemical kinetics, thermodynamics, acid-base chemistry, and substitution reactions in organic compounds, all concepts that map onto our second-term curriculum.
