biography: "Dr. Thu Thuy Dang is currently an assistant professor and a Michael Smith Health Research Foundation Scholar in Biochemistry at the Department of Chemistry, University of British Columbia, Okanagan. She/’s also a UBCO Principal Research Chair in Natural Product
Biosynthesis and Biotechnology. Before joining UBC, she was a postdoctoral fellow (EMBO) at
the John Innes Centre in the laboratory of Dr. Sarah O/’Connor (Norwich, UK). Thuy obtained
her PhD in Biochemistry from the University of Calgary in 2014 and solved the biosynthetic
pathway of the anticancer compound noscapine in opium poppy. Her research program
integrates biochemistry, chemistry, bioinformatics, and molecular genetics to understand and
engineer the biosynthesis of valuable alkaloids from medicinal plants."
talkTitle: 'Plant-based anticancer drugs - from discovery to final product'
abstract: "Plants produce myriads nitrogen-containing heterocyclic metabolites
called alkaloids. These chemicals serve numerous eco-physiological functions in
the plants as well as medicines for humans for thousands of years, such as
anticancer agent vinblastine and the painkiller morphine. Semi-synthetic
derivatives of camptothecin, an alkaloid from happy tree (Camptotheca
acuminata), are potent anticancer agents such as topotecan (Hycamtin) and
irinotecan (Camptosar). Research in Dang/’s lab aims at discovering and
engineering enzymes from happy tree that facilitate the production of topotecan, irinotecan and
new camptothecin-derived analogues. The talk will focus on recent discoveries of new enzymes
and how these allow for further understanding and harnessing of plant biosynthetic pathways
and the production of plant-derived drugs."
