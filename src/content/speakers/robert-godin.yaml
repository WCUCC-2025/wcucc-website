biography: "Dr. Robert Godin established the SolarSpec group (Solar Energy Conversion and Spectroscopy) in 2018 at UBC Okanagan in Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada. The group develops time-resolved spectroscopic tools to better understand carbon-based semiconductors for sustainable energy production, with a healthy dose of physical organic chemistry concepts. Born in Bathurst, New Brunswick, Robert has fostered an interest in photochemistry since the start of his higher education career. He first got introduced to photochemistry and spectroscopy techniques working with Prof. Tito Scaiano during his B.Sc. at the University of Ottawa. He continued to learn advanced optical techniques with Prof. Gonzalo Cosa during his Ph.D. on single molecule spectroscopy at McGill University. Robert then completed a FRQNT-funded postdoctoral stint from 2015 to 2018 with Prof. James Durrant at Imperial College London, UK, to fully enter the field of solar energy conversion."
