biography: "Wes completed his PhD in chemistry at Simon Fraser University in 2011, carrying out research that (mostly) focused on devising new ways to chemically inhibit enzymes responsible for metabolizing complex carbohydrates into simpler sugars. After graduating, his post-doctoral research, also at SFU, focused on the exact opposite process: the enzymes (called glycosyltransferases or GTs for short) that chemically stitch simple sugars together into astonishingly complex mixtures of larger polymers. This research resulted in the development first ever selective GT inhibitors that are active in both cells and live animals, in particular an important enzyme implicated nutrient sensing in cancer cells and neuron health in Alzheimer's disease. After moving to UBC's Okanagan campus in 2015, Wes has spent the past decade educating undergraduate students about the joys of analytical chemistry as well as building a research lab focusing on devising new methods for the analysis of all things carbohydrate. Currently, researchers in the Zandberg lab are developing analytical tools and procedures tailored for projects investigating gut or lung mucus samples, placental tissues, milk (from many different mammals), and of course, grapes and wines. Wes enjoys hiking and gardening when he is not at UBCO or shuttling his kids around to soccer, basketball, volleyball, band,  piano, and rugby practices (and games). He occasionally makes wine."
talkTitle: '"From-Pine-to-Wine": Studies on the air-borne transfer of volatiles into grapes and their impact on wine quality.'
abstract: >
  The Okanagan Valley, like many other grape-producing regions of the world, is experiencing forest fires with increasing frequency. Smoke from even distant fires contains a range of pungent compounds (dubbed volatile phenols; VPs) that are responsible for its aroma. Through currently ill-defined processes, smoke-borne VPs may be absorbed into ripening wine grapes in which they are subsequently metabolized by the enzyme-catalyzed attachment of one or more carbohydrate residues. The resulting VP-glycosides are not volatile or detectible by smell, however, the yeasts used in the fermentation process are capable of cleaving the carbohydrates from VP-glycosides, thus regenerating the smelly VPs from previously inoffensive in-grape precursors. But smoke exposure does not necessarily lead to "smoke-tainted" wines—the 2020 Okanagan vintage is a good example of this. Neither is smoke the sole source of VPs which maybe naturally produced in some grapes (Shiraz) or leached out of the "toasted" oak barrels used for ageing wine. This talk will describe our efforts to predict when smoke-taint will occur (and when it won't) based on the chemical analyses of both grapes and wines. Efforts to mitigate smoke-taint in-winery or prevent it in-vineyard will also be presented. Finally, evidence will be presented to support the idea that absorption of air-borne pine-derived volatiles into wine grapes may, in some instances, have a positive impact on subsequent wine quality.
