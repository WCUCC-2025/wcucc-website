    completely blind since birth. During this seminar, Hoby will focus on his
    chemical research in graduate school, focusing specific attention on
    accessibility and how he made a computational organic chemistry lab
    accessible to him with minimal sighted assistance. Hoby will then outline
    work he is currently doing to make experimental research laboratories
    accessible to blind and low vision researchers. Finally, Hoby will discuss
    his current work as an entrepreneur and how he applies chemistry to
    everything he does.'
