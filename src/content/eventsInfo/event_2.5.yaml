calendarDescription: 'Plants produce myriads nitrogen-containing heterocyclic metabolites
called alkaloids. These chemicals serve numerous eco-physiological functions in
the plants as well as medicines for humans for thousands of years, such as
anticancer agent vinblastine and the painkiller morphine. Semi-synthetic
derivatives of camptothecin, an alkaloid from happy tree (Camptotheca
acuminata), are potent anticancer agents such as topotecan (Hycamtin) and
irinotecan (Camptosar). Research in Dang/’s lab aims at discovering and
engineering enzymes from happy tree that facilitate the production of topotecan, irinotecan and
new camptothecin-derived analogues. The talk will focus on recent discoveries of new enzymes
and how these allow for further understanding and harnessing of plant biosynthetic pathways
and the production of plant-derived drugs.'
