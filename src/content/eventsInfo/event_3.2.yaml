  UBC Okanagan's own Dr. Robert Godin will deliver an engaging lecture on the potential of solar energy conversion and how research into optimizing the efficiency of photocatalytic systems is yielding promising results for green energy production and tackling climate change.
websiteDescription: 'With the full environmental impact of fossil fuel mass consumption becoming clearer, Canada and the world must quickly transition to sustainable energy sources and decarbonize energy production. Solar energy is the most abundant renewable energy source available to humankind. Widespread adoption necessitates pairing with energy storage to overcome the hourly mismatch between solar energy supply and energy demands. Inspired by the natural photosynthesis of plants, solar energy can be stored in high-density chemical bonds. Solar fuels, energy-rich molecules generated by sunlight, can be produced by photocatalysts that drive water splitting (to make H_2) or photoreduction of CO_2 (to make liquid fuels that could easily integrate into our existing fossil-fuel energy infrastructure). Polymeric photocatalysts made of Earth-abundant elements have been extensively developed over the past decade to take advantage of their synthetic tunability. Within this family, carbon nitrides (CN_x) are emerging as leading photocatalysts because of their high photocatalytic performance combined with good stability and facile synthesis. However, significant gaps remain in our knowledge of the photophysical properties of these organic polymeric materials. Determining the pathways and mechanism of photoinduced processes will greatly aid our efforts to engineer better CN_x photocatalysts for solar fuel production, environmental remediation, and synthetic photochemistry. We have developed a first-of-its-kind transient absorption microscopy (TAM) system that can monitor charge carrier dynamics on the microsecondâ€“second timescales together with spatial resolution on the micron scale. Spatial mapping of the charge carrier dynamics with this system provides novel insights into the particle-to-particle heterogeneity and heterogeneity within individual CN_x particles. Our observations point to the presence of at least two different types of trap states that dictate the density of trapped charges and the charge carrier lifetime, respectively. Photocatalysts are often surface-modified with cocatalysts to enhance their photocatalytic activity and drive specific chemical transformations. We use transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) on these types of systems where CN x have been modified by cocatalysts containing metals such as Pt, Ni, and Co. We can observe the impact of these surface modifications on the charge carrier dynamics and glean information on charge transfer pathways and reaction mechanisms. These new insights into the charge carrier dynamics of CN_x can push the field of photocatalyst into uncovering the optimal structure and local environment in defect-rich organic semiconductors such as CN_x.'
