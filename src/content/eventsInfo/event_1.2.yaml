calendarDescription:
    'Dr. Wes Zandberg, associate professor at UBC Okanagan will deliver a
    "fruitful" lecture on the complex glycoscience underlying smoke taint in
    wine grapes, and analytical methods to detect these contaminants.'
websiteDescription: >
    The Okanagan Valley, like many other grape-producing regions of the world,
    is experiencing forest fires with increasing frequency. Smoke from even
    distant fires contains a range of pungent compounds (dubbed volatile
    phenols; VPs) that are responsible for its aroma. Through currently
    ill-defined processes, smoke-borne VPs may be absorbed into ripening wine
    grapes in which they are subsequently metabolized by the enzyme-catalyzed
    attachment of one or more carbohydrate residues. The resulting VP-glycosides
    are not volatile or detectible by smell, however, the yeasts used in the
    fermentation process are capable of cleaving the carbohydrates from
    VP-glycosides, thus regenerating the smelly VPs from previously inoffensive
    in-grape precursors. But smoke exposure does not necessarily lead to
    "smoke-tainted" winesâ€”the 2020 Okanagan vintage is a good example of this.
    Neither is smoke the sole source of VPs which maybe naturally produced in
    some grapes (Shiraz) or leached out of the "toasted" oak barrels used for
    ageing wine. This talk will describe our efforts to predict when smoke-taint
    will occur (and when it won't) based on the chemical analyses of both grapes
    and wines. Efforts to mitigate smoke-taint in-winery or prevent it
    in-vineyard will also be presented. Finally, evidence will be presented to
    support the idea that absorption of air-borne pine-derived volatiles into
    wine grapes may, in some instances, have a positive impact on subsequent
    wine quality.
