biography: 'Hi all! Iâ€™m Brook, a fourth-year biochemistry major. Most of my time is spent in the lab, alongside friends, or enjoying some form of activity. I admire the lifestyle of the Okanagan and the diversity of landscapes and climates it supports. The region piqued my interest in the relationship between agriculture and sustainability and how to support a sector so essential to the economy. My current research studies the impacts of wildfires on grapes and wine, as well as potential interventions to mitigate resulting smoke taint. I am fortunate to work with wineries in the Okanagan to better understand the effects of climate change and work towards a predictive model to prepare for future weather conditions. This region truly has something for everyone. Personally, my favourites are running, skiing, climbing, and (obviously) wine touring.'
