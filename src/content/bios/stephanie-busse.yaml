biography: 'Hey everyone! My name is Stephanie, and I am a third-year biochemistry major here at UBCO. For the past three years, I’ve been an undergraduate research assistant in Dr. Godin’s SolarSpec lab investigating the photocatalytic properties of carbon nitride. My focus has been on functionalized glass slides to grow carbon nitride to be used as photoelectrodes and improving one of our lab’s most used spectroscopy techniques, transient absorption spectroscopy. This year, I have the privilege of serving as the Undergraduate Coordinator for WCUCC 2025. I am so excited to see what this amazing conference holds and to meet the incredible undergraduates that will be attending this year.'
