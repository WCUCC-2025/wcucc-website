biography: 'Hello, fellow nerds! My name is Mitchell, I‚Äôm a fourth-year biochemistry major, and I‚Äôm proud to be working in the role of Event Coordinator. As an undergraduate, I have been extremely fortunate to have been involved in two distinct fields of research during my degree. My first project involved utilising a variety of spectroscopic methods to investigate the photophysical properties of an environmentally friendly photocatalyst modified by our lab, for the purpose of generating clean H2 from lignocellulosic biomass. My current research focuses on exploring the molecular mechanisms of neuroimmune signalling, with the goal of identifying novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. Outside of the lab, I embrace the ‚Äújack of all trades, master of none‚Äù mentality, pursuing skiing, climbing, biking, running, backpacking and almost anything else that will get me outdoors in my free time.'
