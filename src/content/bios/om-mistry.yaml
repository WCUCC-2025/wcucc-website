biography: 'Hi, I am a third year Computer Science major with a particular interest in the fields of full stack software development and AI. I am honoured to be one of the architects of the website and working with the rest of the wonderful team is a great opportunity. I have worked with Professor Abdallah in the past on one of his ongoing projects to better the registration and credit fulfilment system that could possibly be used by the university in the future. I love working on group projects and thus this opportunity to build the website alongside other excellent individuals adds so much to my life experiences. I love dancing and am proud to be a part of the Unite Dance Club on campus in the past and hopefully the future. I also like ice skating and am trying to get myself into skiing recently. '
funFact: 'I am an international student at UBC and have loved my time in Kelowna (and Canada ðŸ™‚)'
