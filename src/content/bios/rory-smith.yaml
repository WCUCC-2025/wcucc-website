biography: "I am a second year biochemistry major who loves all things outdoors. I am an executive for the chemistry course union at UBCO where I get to tutor chemistry students, help plan events, and connect faculty with students. I also volunteer with Bridging of Women in Science Mentorship (BOWS) where I have had the opportunity to mentor female highschool students interested in studying science in university. I wanted to be involved in WCUCC to meet other undergraduate science students from all over Canada and learn about different pathways in science. When I am not studying, I love spending time outdoors, hiking, skiing, swimming, volleyball, running, camping and more. I work as a lifeguard and lifesaving instructor for the YMCA. In the summers, I row while competing Internationally. I'm so excited to bring my diverse skillset to this team!
