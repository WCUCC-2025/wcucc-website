biography: "Hi, I am a third year Chemistry major with a particular interest in the fields of inorganic and main group chemistry. Recently, I have been fortunate enough to work with Dr. Robert Szilagyi in his Computational and Experimental NanoScience Lab. My research revolves around using computational methods to model, predict and characterise various borylene compounds. Iâ€™m hoping to extend my scope of research away from the computer and into the lab to synthesise these compounds and compare my results to my previous calculations. When I'm not staring at a screen, I can be typically found quite far away from any technology. In the summer you can find me rock climbing outdoors or backpacking, while in the winter I can be found skiing and climbing colourful plastic rocks, better known as indoor bouldering. "
funFact: 'I am very accident-prone. On my first ride after purchasing my road bike, I crashed into a metal pole while trying to figure out how to change gears.'
