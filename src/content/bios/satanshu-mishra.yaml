biography: 'Hello There! I’m Satanshu, a Computer Science graduate from UBCO. This year, I will be one of the architects responsible for designing and building the website for WCUCC! I’ve had many interests and hobbies over the years. However, solving the many challenges of the digiverse one bit at a time is one I have constantly come back to and taken up full-time. I’m also conducting research in the field of Machine Learning. I just finished developing a platform to personalise the learning experiences in a first year CS-course based on students’ performance. I’ve and continue to be involved in various other projects such as the 2022 UBCO’s International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition time developing the teams Wiki, Designing and Developing a platform for Secure Encrypted Communication between users as part of my Capstone. I make it a point to always keep an open-mind and continue to learn from those around me. My hobbies include playing the guitar, cooking and solving puzzles.'
