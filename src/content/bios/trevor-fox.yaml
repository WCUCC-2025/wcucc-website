biography: 'I am Trevor, a biochemistry major in his fourth year at UBCO. This year, I serve dutifully as one of the architects for this website! I also conduct research focused on the field of metabolomics. I just finished developing and validating a method to predict the species of origin of frankincense based on 60 and 400 MHz NMR spectra. In the past, I have also led the wet lab of UBCO’s International Genetically Engineered Machine competition team, where we endeavoured to produce bioluminescent cyanobacteria. I love exploring new avenues to accomplish things, as evident in my line of research. My hobbies include playing piano, programming, ice skating/skiing, and cooking. One might say I am "multivalent!"'
funFact: "Bismuth is my favourite element, not only because it’s pretty, but also because its half-life is longer than the universe's age."
