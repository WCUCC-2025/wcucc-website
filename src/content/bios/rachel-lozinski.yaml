biography: "Hello! My name is Rachel, and I am a third-year chemistry major with a huge passion for chemistry and the outdoors. In light of chemistry involvement I am an executive and a chemistry tutor with the Chemistry Course Union, a great opportunity to bring students and faculty together using chemistry. As well, I am a part of Westcoast Women in Engineering, Science, and Technology (WWEST) helping to run science-themed camps for children. Outside of chemistry I can be found outdoors taking part in many activities including hiking, camping, and swimming, in the winters I also play ringette. Taking a part in the planning of the 2025 Western Canadian Undergraduate Conference is something I greatly look forward to, we have big plans coming!"
funFact: 'I love to crochet as well, my favourite activity is seeing things in a store and saying “I could make that!”'
