biography: "Hello, everyone! My name is Anastasia, and I recently graduated from UBCO majoring in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. I am happy to be a part of the WCUCC 2025 team as a graphic designer! In my final year at university, I worked on discovering novel enzymes responsible for production of pharmaceutical compounds. This experience enhanced my passion about enzyme evolution and biocatalysis - something I am hoping to pursue in the future. I also was part of the Okanagan iGEM team, both as a Finance lead and Wetlab member. Participating in iGEM sparked my interest in synthetic biology - I truly belive that it can save the world. Now that I graduated, I have more time for my hobbies - reading, playing piano, baking, and taking care of two adorable cats. I can't wait to see where life takes me next!"
funFact: "I've read all books on the Barnes and Noble's selection of the 50 most essential books."
