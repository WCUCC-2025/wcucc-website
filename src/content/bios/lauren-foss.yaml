biography: "Hi! I’m Lauren, a third-year chemistry major here at UBCO. Through my passion for science and chemistry, I have been very fortunate to represent a part of UBCO’s chemistry community, the Chemistry Course Union, as both an executive and a tutor. I am thrilled to be representing WCUCC in the Okanagan in 2025 to showcase and bring together the brilliant minds and work of undergraduates and speakers nationwide. Being a born and raised Albertan, I have fallen in love with the Okanagan throughout the course of my degree, and when I am not in school, I love to get outside any chance I can through hiking, backpacking, skiing, and running."
funFact: 'I was a volleyball player for seven years up until moving to Kelowna!'
